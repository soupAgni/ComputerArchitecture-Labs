This git repo includes the labs I have worked on as part of my Computer Architecture class. The language I learnt was VHDL.
I learnt how to make singular components like adders and registers and then collaborated with a team member to to first implement a single stage MIPS processor where values are fetched and executed all within a single clock cycle. 
My partner and I worked closely together to implement the pipelined version of the processor to execute 45 MIPS instructions.

Skills and knowledge gained:
All of the projects and labs in this class put heavy emphasis on my debugging and problem solving skills. 
I was able to gain a deeper understanding of VHDL and digital logic. An acute attention to detail and a deep understanding of the underlying principals were required to create an error-free design
